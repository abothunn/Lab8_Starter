***How are graceful degradation and service workers related?***

To first clarify, graceful degradation is principle that an application, either modern or a little older, has fall backs that still allows the app to maintain a fully functional experience for the user. To clarify the other, service workers are scripts located in the web browser with a multitude of functions, some of them being intercepting network requests and managing cache. This is where the two connect, as service workers can actually cache the resoures essential to running the site properly, functionality wise. Having service workers that create fall backs as such is the exact principle of graceful degredation, where the site or app keeps essential functionality and usability where conditions may not always be ideal.
